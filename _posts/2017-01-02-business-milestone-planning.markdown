In business book jargon milestones are major events in the life of a business. They are performance benchmarks like "break-even" or big projects like "launch the website." Identifying and documenting milestones before starting a business is a milestone plan. It gives you a roadmap to follow while you go about the daily task of running your business.

I was introduced to milestone planning by [Harvard Business Review's](https://hbr.org/) book [_Creating Business Plans_](https://hbr.org/product/creating-business-plans-hbr-20-minute-manager-series/16998E-KND-ENG). My milestone plan is part of my business plan, but it can be used independently too. 

According to the book: 

> A milestone plan gives readers a timeline for the creation of a successful business...Include only major events (not each individual step) and choose milestones that can be clearly defined and easily measured...Use generic dates, such as "month six" or "year one," rather than actual dates. 

It shows major events taking place in one month increments starting when the business opens. It's designed to be easy to show potential investors. 

My business plan, however, is mostly reference material for me – [a guide I use to help me run my business](http://mduncan.me/a-zero-investor-business-plan). So, my milestone plan also serves this purpose and required some modification. 

A timeline is a static graphic that's difficult to change. Instead of a timeline I use a spreadsheet. I keep mine in Google Drive where I can make changes from any of my devices. My milestone plan isn't set in stone – things inevitably come up – so it's important to be able to move events and goals around and stay flexible.

In addition to tracking when milestones will be completed, I've added two other parameters. I also track status – not started, in progress, and completed – and the quarter when I plan to work on it. These new parameters let me use my milestone plan as a productivity tool too. I check it weekly and use it to make sure I'm on schedule to accomplish larger goals throughout the year. 

Here's what it looks like, if you're curious:

<div class="responsive-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Milestone</th>
      <th>Status</th>

    </tr>
