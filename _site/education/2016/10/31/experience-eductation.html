    <p>Good designers, software engineers, and artists are always learning. For anyone in a creative field, teaching yourself new skills is a professional necessity. Hoping to get better at learning, I recently read a couple of books on educational theory. One was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_and_Education_(book)"><em>Experience and Education</em></a>.</p>

<p>John Dewey wrote <em>Experience and Education</em> in 1938. He describes how some experiences result in learning while others don’t. Dewey realized that quality educational experiences do at least two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Continuity – Promote further learning.</li>
  <li>Interaction – Involve working with other people.</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither happen without some planning. Without continuity and interaction, you risk having unproductive learning experiences.</p>

<p>You watch a video lecture, do a tutorial, or read a book. These popular adult learning activities often happen in isolation. Some happen haphazardly. On their own, these activities lack continuity. Reading one book on Ruby, for example, didn’t make me much of a programmer. I could recall basic information, but that’s about it. Nothing about the experience made it memorable.</p>

<p>Every effort to learn must be in the service of something larger. Removing isolated, contextless experiences helps. Or at least be sure that you’re giving context to your activities.</p>

<p>Now, I start learning something new by thinking of a project.<sup>1</sup> Then I break it down into smaller projects. Each small project leads to the next. My learning activities become associated with the experience of making something. If a book or some other resource helps, then I use it. But I do nothing unless it serves some larger goal that moves me forward.</p>

<p>As an introvert, I was skeptical about how interaction could improve my learning. So, including interaction in my learning process was difficult. Not interacting with people is always easier for me.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been presenting on design topics at work. I prepare a presentation. I also have to think about the topic from multiple viewpoints. I expect challenges to my thinking and plan different responses, especially if I’m presenting something to an executive team or internal shareholders. You may be familiar with the stress of planning for a talk or a big meeting, but I always find these experiences valuable because I learn so much.</p>

<p>You don’t have to present at a conference, or run a local meet up to benefit from interacting with people. Have a conversation, start a discussion with someone in your household, or invite a friend over. Explore your topic in as much detail as possible. I schedule time to present things to my wife. And don’t forget to ask the other person about what she’s learning too.</p>

<p>Interaction and continuity are ways to give context to learning. Where, when, and how you learn (contexts) are all integral parts of <em>what</em> you learn. Giving context to learning is what drives experience. According to Dewey, good experiences lead to good learning.</p>

<p>The main thing I took away from <em>Experience and Education</em> was to be more intentional. If a learning activity doesn’t include continuity or interaction, I don’t do it. Experiential learning takes planning. Plan learning experiences not as isolated acitivities, but as a part of a larger goal. It also helps to talk to someone about it.</p>
