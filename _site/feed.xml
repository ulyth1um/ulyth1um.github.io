        <title>Experience and Education for Designers and Developers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Good designers, software engineers, and artists are always learning. For anyone in a creative field, teaching yourself new skills is a professional necessity. Hoping to get better at learning, I recently read a couple of books on educational theory. One was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_and_Education_(book)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience and Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Dewey wrote &lt;em&gt;Experience and Education&lt;/em&gt; in 1938. He describes how some experiences result in learning while others don’t. Dewey realized that quality educational experiences do at least two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuity – Promote further learning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interaction – Involve working with other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither happen without some planning. Without continuity and interaction, you risk having unproductive learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You watch a video lecture, do a tutorial, or read a book. These popular adult learning activities often happen in isolation. Some happen haphazardly. On their own, these activities lack continuity. Reading one book on Ruby, for example, didn’t make me much of a programmer. I could recall basic information, but that’s about it. Nothing about the experience made it memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every effort to learn must be in the service of something larger. Removing isolated, contextless experiences helps. Or at least be sure that you’re giving context to your activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I start learning something new by thinking of a project.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Then I break it down into smaller projects. Each small project leads to the next. My learning activities become associated with the experience of making something. If a book or some other resource helps, then I use it. But I do nothing unless it serves some larger goal that moves me forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an introvert, I was skeptical about how interaction could improve my learning. So, including interaction in my learning process was difficult. Not interacting with people is always easier for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been presenting on design topics at work. I prepare a presentation. I also have to think about the topic from multiple viewpoints. I expect challenges to my thinking and plan different responses, especially if I’m presenting something to an executive team or internal shareholders. You may be familiar with the stress of planning for a talk or a big meeting, but I always find these experiences valuable because I learn so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to present at a conference, or run a local meet up to benefit from interacting with people. Have a conversation, start a discussion with someone in your household, or invite a friend over. Explore your topic in as much detail as possible. I schedule time to present things to my wife. And don’t forget to ask the other person about what she’s learning too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interaction and continuity are ways to give context to learning. Where, when, and how you learn (contexts) are all integral parts of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you learn. Giving context to learning is what drives experience. According to Dewey, good experiences lead to good learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing I took away from &lt;em&gt;Experience and Education&lt;/em&gt; was to be more intentional. If a learning activity doesn’t include continuity or interaction, I don’t do it. Experiential learning takes planning. Plan learning experiences not as isolated acitivities, but as a part of a larger goal. It also helps to talk to someone about it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2011/02/01/how-should-i-get-started-with-programming-which&quot;&gt;This was great advice from Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;If you have a specific idea, the goal of achieving it and the incremental progress along the way will motivate you to keep going.&quot;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>A Zero Investor Business Plan</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many books, articles, and websites that explain how to write a business plan. Most tell you to follow their advice on what investors will want to see and plan accordingly. And if you want to start a small business, they say focus on a local bank instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example from one &lt;a href=&quot;http://gsl.mit.edu/media/programs/india-bms-summer-2013/materials/how-to-write-a-great-business-plan.pdf&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to speak the language of investors and also make sure you have asked yourself the right questions before setting out on the most daunting journey of a businessperson’s career—I recommend basing your business plan on the framework that follows. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their assumption is that your business will need significant funding. By following their instructions, you can be sure that your plan will serve a very narrow purpose. You might not use it beyond the funding phase. It will have boring section titles like ‘executive summary’ and ‘personnel plan.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are a lot of different ways to write a business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wouldn’t want outside funding to start my design business. So I had to rethink the whole point of my business plan. While the books and articles offered a lot of good advice,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I had to write for a different audience: me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t focus on investors or the bank. Instead, I made a resource that I can reference again and again. It’s something I would look forward to actually using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan includes several things that aren’t often mentioned in books or articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-personas&quot;&gt;Client personas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent time creating profiles, or personas, for the different types of clients I hope to work with. I used the same personas again when I designed a brand identity and website for my business. And again when I created an editorial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;editorial-and-content-strategy&quot;&gt;Editorial and content strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing and talking about my business is a big part of attracting clients. I spent a lot of time creating an editorial calendar and setting goals to post to my website at least twice monthly. I also worked on a content strategy that I’ll refer to on a variety of business projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;milestones&quot;&gt;Milestones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about milestones in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/product/creating-business-plans-hbr-20-minute-manager-series/16998E-KND-ENG&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Business Plans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is one recommendation I gladly took. But this is the only book or article that mentioned anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A milestone plan gives your readers a timeline for the creation of a successful business. Develop an ambitious schedule that you can meet, while still giving yourself room to handle unexpected problems that may slow you down….Use generic dates, such as “month six” or “year one” rather than actual dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milestones aren’t calendar events, they are only for large and important events. I reference my milestones spreadsheet weekly. It’s incredibly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best business plans are purpose built. They address the needs of the business owner. Investors may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m not looking for investors, I documented implementation details that make self-funding possible. I planned to start as soon as I could with resources that I had available. My business plan, written for me instead of some mythical investor, reflects this strategy. I reference parts of it all the time. By broadening the scope, I’ve created a living document that’s vital to my day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Typical business writing hyperbole. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I agree that a good business plan requires asking the right questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Before I Write a Business Plan</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Good business plans take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the work is thinking, researching, writing, and revising. A business plan should be easy to implement and understand. It should build confidence in an idea. But it shouldn’t be long or complicated. Careful editing takes considerable time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process can take months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if your business plan doesn’t build confidence in your idea? It might not. You’ve done all the work, the hours of revision, and your idea has holes. Maybe it’s not the right time or place, or you’ve made too many assumptions about the industry or market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business plan should reveal irreparable flaws; that’s its job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After considering its flaws, you may decide to abandon the idea. While okay, spending months on an idea that goes nowhere  isn’t the most efficient use of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I take the time to write a business plan, I spend an afternoon answering the questions below. They help me uncover flaws before I get too far. While they don’t guarantee a great business plan, they do reduce the risk of it ending up in the trash. When I’m done, I know if it’s an idea worth pursuing. If it’s not, I’ve only spent an afternoon working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions I work through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is the product or service? Who are the customers? How can I simplify the idea? Or, how can I expand it? How can I present a new or unique take on the product or service? What one-thing will this business be known for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start by simplifying the idea. It’s okay to think big, but I keep big ideas in a notebook for later. I’m looking for an idea that’s easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good businesses focus on doing one thing well. They are built around a simple idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What problem does the product or service solve for customers? How can I reach customers? Is accessing them affordable or expensive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I think about customer needs. The business &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; solve a problem. These questions prompt me to consider the relationship between what the business will do and what people need or expect from the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think about my access to customers. I avoid markets where access is difficult, expensive, or tightly controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What industry will this business be part of? Is it large and growing? Who are the top competitors? What are their weaknesses? What experience do I have in this industry? Is industry and market data readily available? If so, from what sources? What experts can I talk to about this industry or market? What are niche areas in this market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my business decisions will be informed by industry and market data. I need to know what’s available. And I need to think critically about the quality of that data.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also research niche areas in the market.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This gives me clues about how I can narrow the business idea further. But I’m careful to avoid niches that are trendy. Trends, by nature, do not offer a stable foundation to build a business on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is the estimated cost to produce the product or service? Is the profit margin low or high? What will the estimated minimum start up costs be? Estimate how many months it will take to reach positive cash flow.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; How much money do I need to support myself for three months? For one year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I charge for my product or service depends on how much I need to make a comfortable living. I also plan a financial buffer of at least three months. My goal is to reach positive cash flow during that period. And the buffer helps me cover living expenses while I get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If positive cash flow seems unlikely in the first 3-6 months, I need to rethink the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At minimum, how many employees will I need at start up? What pieces of equipment are essential? Can I do without physical space? If so, for how long? Is the business dependent on other people? Who? How many hours per week can I devote to this business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I look for ways to reduce dependencies. Some equipment will be essential. Sometimes people need to be hired right away. But if I can do without it at the start, I will. Starting the business will be easier, and cost less, with fewer dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my responses might tell me this is a bad business idea. I know to move on if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It doesn’t solve an obvious problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There isn’t enough industry or market data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Positive cash flow seems unlikely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is too dependent on other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, however, I’m satisfied with all of my answers, I’m ready to start a business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Who conducted the study, using what methods? What are their biases?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market&quot;&gt;Niche Market, Wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
