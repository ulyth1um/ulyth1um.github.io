    <h1><a href="/year-in-review-2016">Year In Review: 2016</a></h1>
    
      <p>2016 was a big set up year for me.</p>

<p>I worked on starting a side business selling design services and got ready to take on some clients. I <em>only just</em> finished everything by the end of the year – and I really had to stretch myself to get it done. But I’m happy to note that I’ll be taking clients in 2017.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick list of what I did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Switched departments at work, from Software Development to Marketing</li>
  <li>Changed job titles, from Front-end Developer to User Experience Designer</li>
  <li>Went to Web Design Day in Pittsburgh, a great conference</li>
  <li>Registered my business</li>
  <li>Completed my business plan</li>
  <li>Launched my website</li>
  <li>Landed my first client</li>
  <li>Almost bought a house</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>At work I changed my job title to User Experience designer allowing me to focus more fully on research, strategy, analytics, and A/B testing.</p>

<p>Starting a side business while working full-time has been a challenge. More often than not I’m working early in the morning, at night, and on weekends. But I’m committed to making it work and I don’t plan on keeping these hours forever.</p>

<p>I also spent a lot of time creating processes and workflows to make client work more efficient. I’m already a process driven person, but these will help while I balance working a day job with managing a side business.</p>

<p>Looking forward to 2017, I’ll launch a couple of projects that allow me to do more public design work. I can’t say much now, but most of them will be announced and then written about here in the next couple of months.</p>

    <h1><a href="/business-milestone-planning">Business Milestone Planning</a></h1>
    
      <p>In business book jargon milestones are major events in the life of a business. They are performance benchmarks like “break-even” or big projects like “launch the website.” Identifying and documenting milestones before starting a business is a milestone plan. It gives you a roadmap to follow while you go about the daily task of running your business.</p>

<p>I was introduced to milestone planning by <a href="https://hbr.org/">Harvard Business Review’s</a> book <a href="https://hbr.org/product/creating-business-plans-hbr-20-minute-manager-series/16998E-KND-ENG"><em>Creating Business Plans</em></a>. My milestone plan is part of my business plan, but it can be used independently too.</p>

<p>According to the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A milestone plan gives readers a timeline for the creation of a successful business…Include only major events (not each individual step) and choose milestones that can be clearly defined and easily measured…Use generic dates, such as “month six” or “year one,” rather than actual dates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shows major events taking place in one month increments starting when the business opens. It’s designed to be easy to show potential investors.</p>

<p>My business plan, however, is mostly reference material for me – <a href="http://mduncan.me/a-zero-investor-business-plan">a guide I use to help me run my business</a>. So, my milestone plan also serves this purpose and required some modification.</p>

<p>A timeline is a static graphic that’s difficult to change. Instead of a timeline I use a spreadsheet. I keep mine in Google Drive where I can make changes from any of my devices. My milestone plan isn’t set in stone – things inevitably come up – so it’s important to be able to move events and goals around and stay flexible.</p>

<p>In addition to tracking when milestones will be completed, I’ve added two other parameters. I also track status – not started, in progress, and completed – and the quarter when I plan to work on it. These new parameters let me use my milestone plan as a productivity tool too. I check it weekly and use it to make sure I’m on schedule to accomplish larger goals throughout the year.</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like, if you’re curious:</p>

    <h1><a href="/a-zero-investor-business-plan">A Zero Investor Business Plan</a></h1>
    
      <p>There are many books, articles, and websites that explain how to write a business plan. Most tell you to follow their advice on what investors will want to see and plan accordingly. And if you want to start a small business, they say focus on a local bank instead.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from one <a href="http://gsl.mit.edu/media/programs/india-bms-summer-2013/materials/how-to-write-a-great-business-plan.pdf">Harvard Business Review article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to speak the language of investors and also make sure you have asked yourself the right questions before setting out on the most daunting journey of a businessperson’s career—I recommend basing your business plan on the framework that follows. <sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their assumption is that your business will need significant funding. By following their instructions, you can be sure that your plan will serve a very narrow purpose. You might not use it beyond the funding phase. It will have boring section titles like ‘executive summary’ and ‘personnel plan.’</p>

<p>But there are a lot of different ways to write a business plan.</p>

<p>I knew I wouldn’t want outside funding to start my design business. So I had to rethink the whole point of my business plan. While the books and articles offered a lot of good advice,<sup>2</sup> I had to write for a different audience: me.</p>

<p>I didn’t focus on investors or the bank. Instead, I made a resource that I can reference again and again. It’s something I would look forward to actually using.</p>

<p>My plan includes several things that aren’t often mentioned in books or articles:</p>

<h3 id="client-personas">Client personas</h3>

<p>I spent time creating profiles, or personas, for the different types of clients I hope to work with. I used the same personas again when I designed a brand identity and website for my business. And again when I created an editorial strategy.</p>

<h3 id="editorial-and-content-strategy">Editorial and content strategy</h3>

<p>Writing and talking about my business is a big part of attracting clients. I spent a lot of time creating an editorial calendar and setting goals to post to my website at least twice monthly. I also worked on a content strategy that I’ll refer to on a variety of business projects.</p>

<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>

<p>I read about milestones in <a href="https://hbr.org/product/creating-business-plans-hbr-20-minute-manager-series/16998E-KND-ENG"><em>Creating Business Plans</em></a>. This is one recommendation I gladly took. But this is the only book or article that mentioned anything like it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A milestone plan gives your readers a timeline for the creation of a successful business. Develop an ambitious schedule that you can meet, while still giving yourself room to handle unexpected problems that may slow you down….Use generic dates, such as “month six” or “year one” rather than actual dates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Milestones aren’t calendar events, they are only for large and important events. I reference my milestones spreadsheet weekly. It’s incredibly useful.</p>

<p>I think the best business plans are purpose built. They address the needs of the business owner. Investors may not be necessary.</p>

<p>Since I’m not looking for investors, I documented implementation details that make self-funding possible. I planned to start as soon as I could with resources that I had available. My business plan, written for me instead of some mythical investor, reflects this strategy. I reference parts of it all the time. By broadening the scope, I’ve created a living document that’s vital to my day to day work.</p>

    <li>Typical business writing hyperbole. </li>
