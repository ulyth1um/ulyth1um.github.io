    <h1><a href="/content-inventory-and-pattern-vocabularies">Content Inventory and Pattern Vocabularies in Web Design</a></h1>
    
      <p>At the beginning of a web design project, it’s common to inventory content from the existing site. During a <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/content-inventory.html">typical inventory</a> I catalog page titles, urls, author, owner, and metadata in a big spreadsheet. It’s a good way to survey the content and figure out what areas need work.</p>

<p>But inventories can be doubly useful if you use a pattern based design methodology.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>It’s a good opportunity to start thinking about what design patterns are needed on the new site. I’ve added additional columns to my inventory spreadsheet template for pattern names, categories, and descriptions. When I review and audit the inventory I look at the existing site for elements and sections that are similar or repeated often. Things to note, particularly in sites that weren’t built with patterns in mind, include sidebars, buttons, calls to action, or any similar elements that I see over and over again.</p>

<p>I’m also starting to think about vocabulary. What patterns need unique names and how do I classify them? This taxonomy – the pattern names and their classification – will form the basis of a pattern library later in the design process.</p>

      Additional columns added for pattern planning: pattern (name), category, and description. Also, there were no heading tags so I've made a note to correct them in the new site architecture.

<p>My HTML, CSS, and front-end JavaScript are all created to address needs cataloged during this early inventory. It’s a great place to start whether you use <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a> or your own system, like I do.</p>

    <h1><a href="/year-in-review-2016">Year In Review: 2016</a></h1>
    
      <p>2016 was a big set up year for me.</p>

<p>I worked on starting a side business selling design services and got ready to take on some clients. I <em>only just</em> finished everything by the end of the year – and I really had to stretch myself to get it done. But I’m happy to note that I’ll be taking clients in 2017.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick list of what I did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Switched departments at work, from Software Development to Marketing</li>
  <li>Changed job titles, from Front-end Developer to User Experience Designer</li>
  <li>Went to Web Design Day in Pittsburgh, a great conference</li>
  <li>Registered my business</li>
  <li>Completed my business plan</li>
  <li>Launched my website</li>
  <li>Landed my first client</li>
  <li>Almost bought a house</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>At work I changed my job title to User Experience designer allowing me to focus more fully on research, strategy, analytics, and A/B testing.</p>

<p>Starting a side business while working full-time has been a challenge. More often than not I’m working early in the morning, at night, and on weekends. But I’m committed to making it work and I don’t plan on keeping these hours forever.</p>

<p>I also spent a lot of time creating processes and workflows to make client work more efficient. I’m already a process driven person, but these will help while I balance working a day job with managing a side business.</p>

<p>Looking forward to 2017, I’ll launch a couple of projects that allow me to do more public design work. I can’t say much now, but most of them will be announced and then written about here in the next couple of months.</p>

    <h1><a href="/business-milestone-planning">Business Milestone Planning</a></h1>
    
      <p>In business book jargon milestones are major events in the life of a business. They are performance benchmarks like “break-even” or big projects like “launch the website.” Identifying and documenting milestones before starting a business is a milestone plan. It gives you a roadmap to follow while you go about the daily task of running your business.</p>

<p>I was introduced to milestone planning by <a href="https://hbr.org/">Harvard Business Review’s</a> book <a href="https://hbr.org/product/creating-business-plans-hbr-20-minute-manager-series/16998E-KND-ENG"><em>Creating Business Plans</em></a>. My milestone plan is part of my business plan, but it can be used independently too.</p>

<p>According to the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A milestone plan gives readers a timeline for the creation of a successful business…Include only major events (not each individual step) and choose milestones that can be clearly defined and easily measured…Use generic dates, such as “month six” or “year one,” rather than actual dates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shows major events taking place in one month increments starting when the business opens. It’s designed to be easy to show potential investors.</p>

<p>My business plan, however, is mostly reference material for me – <a href="http://mduncan.me/a-zero-investor-business-plan">a guide I use to help me run my business</a>. So, my milestone plan also serves this purpose and required some modification.</p>

<p>A timeline is a static graphic that’s difficult to change. Instead of a timeline I use a spreadsheet. I keep mine in Google Drive where I can make changes from any of my devices. My milestone plan isn’t set in stone – things inevitably come up – so it’s important to be able to move events and goals around and stay flexible.</p>

<p>In addition to tracking when milestones will be completed, I’ve added two other parameters. I also track status – not started, in progress, and completed – and the quarter when I plan to work on it. These new parameters let me use my milestone plan as a productivity tool too. I check it weekly and use it to make sure I’m on schedule to accomplish larger goals throughout the year.</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like, if you’re curious:</p>
