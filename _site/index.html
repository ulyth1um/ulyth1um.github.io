    <h1><a href="/monozukuri-web-design">Monozurki In Web Design & Development</a></h1>
    
      <p>I came across the Japanese term ‘monozukuri’ in Monocle magazine. Roughly, it means “the art, science, and craft of making things.” Though there are many layers of meaning.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Monozukuri is a term that describes the philosophy behind a reinvigoration of Japan’s manufacturing industry in the 1990s. In reading about it I started thinking about how this philosophy could be applied to what I do: web design and development.</p>

<p>I understand it to mean when you make something, how you make it is just as important as what you produce. As a web designer and developer, there are three things that I like about Monozukuri.</p>

<h2 id="a-focus-on-intangibles">A focus on intangibles</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Monozurki is used to describe technology and processes integrating development, production, and procurement, it also includes intangible qualities such as craftsmanship and dedication to continuous improvement.<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s easy to move quickly from project to project, especially if someone else sets your deadlines for you. But this is a bad way to work. Your processes will become outdated and the product will suffer as a result.</p>

<p>If you have control over your project schedule you can build in time to focus on craftsmanship and continous improvement. After-project reviews are Monozukuri. During reviews you or your team can think about your work and ways to improve processes. This way you can review without distraction and before being burdened by the stress of the next project. It’s a great way to reflect on what worked and what didn’t.</p>

<h2 id="appreciation-for-tools-and-processes-even-though-they-never-see-the-light-of-day">Appreciation for tools and processes, even though they never see the light of day</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . appreciation and reverence for things animate and inanimate . . . recognition of prototyping materials’ sacrifice is particularly interesting because they never got to fulfill their destiny of being made into products sold on the market and enjoyed by customers.<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We should always appreciate the process and tools that allow us to create a product. Enjoy them. Have reverence for them.</p>

<p>At the end of a project you’ll have a mountain of supporting material: research documents, wire frames, sketches, spreadsheets, source code . . . The final product might get all the attention, but most of the work happens in these materials and because of processes you’ve spent many hours developing.</p>

<h2 id="de-emphasizing-the-person">De-emphasizing the person</h2>

<p>The roots of Monozukuri are ‘mono’ and ‘zukuri.’<sup>4</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘mono,’ the thing that is made, and ‘zukuri,’ the act of making. The person doing the making is de-emphasized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we talk about creativity, we often focus on the person over the act. But focusing so much on the creator is a hinderance, particularly when we think about our own work. And if you’re like me, you don’t focus on good things like past accomplishments. You focus on failure. Especially when you’re an anxious or self-conscious creator. Someone else will always be the better programmer or designer.</p>

<p>By de-emphasizing the person – you and your ego – in the Monozukuri way, it’s easier to shift your focus away from insecurities and onto the process of making, where it belongs.</p>

    <h1><a href="/pattern-naming-conventions">Pattern Naming Conventions in Web Design</a></h1>
    
      <p>Unlike <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors">CSS selectors</a> – <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors">classes</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors">ids</a> – that no one except designers or developers see, some of us are exposing our <a href="http://patternlab.io/">design systems and their naming conventions</a> to clients during projects. Names of design elements are exposed in a way that they weren’t before. But do names really matter to our clients?</p>

<p>If you’ve spent time working with any type of complex system, you know that naming things is important. Relationships and hierarchies are expressed through names. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)">naming conventions</a> don’t work or aren’t easy to follow, our understanding of the system falls apart. And that makes it hard to use and maintain.</p>

<p>Pattern based design is an attempt a systematizing the design and front-end development of websites. In the <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">Atomic Design</a> system naming conventions are an attempt to make the structure of the system more understandable. Single HTML elements are atoms, groups of elements are molecules, and sections are organisms.</p>

<p>It works OK in practice. But I’ve found from experience that some clients struggle with the <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">abstraction</a>. It can also be difficult for me to explain and a time consuming part of a meeting that we’d both like to keep short and to-the-point. My clients have mostly been concerned with the larger parts of the system: templates and pages, sometimes sections. But they’re mostly underwhelmed reviewing block level elements.</p>

<p>So I don’t use abstract naming conventions or even expose them to lower-level patterns other than font choice and sizing.</p>

<p>I have my own light-weight pattern library tool. While inspired by Atomic Design and Pattern Lab, it’s got a smaller footprint. Rather than abstract names at the top level of the system – atoms, molecules, organisms – I use more literal names. My top-level pattern categories are: elements, blocks, and sections. This naming convention is an attempt at more semantic naming. ‘Elements’ for example, correspond to basic HTML elements like ‘&lt;p&gt;’. Content blocks are just ‘blocks’. And sections are . . . ‘sections.’</p>

<p>While I spend a little bit of time going over how I work with clients, I’m not that concerned with making sure they get the metaphor. I’d rather spend the limited time I have to get feedback on looking at the things they want to see in a context that’s familiar to them.</p>

<p>The best thing about designing and developing with modular systems is their flexibility. It’s easy to use the underlying principles of something like Atomic Design but adapt them for the types of projects you work on. Look at the variety of systems out there: <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/">Lightning Design System</a>, MailChimp’s <a href="https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns">Pattern Library</a>. If you’re considering a pattern based approach to front-end design, don’t feel like you need to be locked into a specific tool. And it’s really not too difficult to develop your own.</p>

    <h1><a href="/content-inventory-and-pattern-vocabularies">Content Inventory and Pattern Vocabularies in Web Design</a></h1>
    
      <p>At the beginning of a web design project, it’s common to inventory content from the existing site. During a <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/content-inventory.html">typical inventory</a> I catalog page titles, urls, author, owner, and metadata in a big spreadsheet. It’s a good way to survey the content and figure out what areas need work.</p>

<p>But inventories can be doubly useful if you use a pattern based design methodology.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>It’s a good opportunity to start thinking about what design patterns are needed on the new site. I’ve added additional columns to my inventory spreadsheet template for pattern names, categories, and descriptions. When I review and audit the inventory I look at the existing site for elements and sections that are similar or repeated often. Things to note, particularly in sites that weren’t built with patterns in mind, include sidebars, buttons, calls to action, or any similar elements that I see over and over again.</p>

<p>I’m also starting to think about vocabulary. What patterns need unique names and how do I classify them? This taxonomy – the pattern names and their classification – will form the basis of a pattern library later in the design process.</p>

      Additional columns added for pattern planning: pattern (name), category, and description. Also, there were no heading tags so I've made a note to correct them in the new site architecture.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>My HTML, CSS, and front-end JavaScript are all created to address needs cataloged during this early inventory. It’s a great place to start whether you use <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a> or your own system, like I do.</p>
