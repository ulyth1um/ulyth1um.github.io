    <h1><a href="/pattern-naming-conventions">Pattern Naming Conventions in Web Design</a></h1>
    
      <p>Unlike <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors">CSS selectors</a> – <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors">classes</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors">ids</a> – that no one except designers or developers see, some of us are exposing our <a href="http://patternlab.io/">design systems and their naming conventions</a> to clients during projects. Names of design elements are exposed in a way that they weren’t before. But do names really matter to our clients?</p>

<p>If you’ve spent time working with any type of complex system, you know that naming things is important. Relationships and hierarchies are expressed through names. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)">naming conventions</a> don’t work or aren’t easy to follow, our understanding of the system falls apart. And that makes it hard to use and maintain.</p>

<p>Pattern based design is an attempt a systematizing the design and front-end development of websites. In the <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">Atomic Design</a> system naming conventions are an attempt to make the structure of the system more understandable. Single HTML elements are atoms, groups of elements are molecules, and sections are organisms.</p>

<p>It works OK in practice. But I’ve found from experience that some clients struggle with the <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">abstraction</a>. It can also be difficult for me to explain and a time consuming part of a meeting that we’d both like to keep short and to-the-point. My clients have mostly been concerned with the larger parts of the system: templates and pages, sometimes sections. But they’re mostly underwhelmed reviewing block level elements.</p>

<p>So I don’t use abstract naming conventions or even expose them to lower-level patterns other than font choice and sizing.</p>

<p>I have my own light-weight pattern library tool. While inspired by Atomic Design and Pattern Lab, it’s got a smaller footprint. Rather than abstract names at the top level of the system – atoms, molecules, organisms – I use more literal names. My top-level pattern categories are: elements, blocks, and sections. This naming convention is an attempt at more semantic naming. ‘Elements’ for example, correspond to basic HTML elements like ‘&lt;p&gt;’. Content blocks are just ‘blocks’. And sections are . . . ‘sections.’</p>

<p>While I spend a little bit of time going over how I work with clients, I’m not that concerned with making sure they get the metaphor. I’d rather spend the limited time I have to get feedback on looking at the things they want to see in a context that’s familiar to them.</p>

<p>The best thing about designing and developing with modular systems is their flexibility. It’s easy to use the underlying principles of something like Atomic Design but adapt them for the types of projects you work on. Look at the variety of systems out there: <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/">Lightning Design System</a>, MailChimp’s <a href="https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns">Pattern Library</a>. If you’re considering a pattern based approach to front-end design, don’t feel like you need to be locked into a specific tool. And it’s really not too difficult to develop your own.</p>

    <h1><a href="/content-inventory-and-pattern-vocabularies">Content Inventory and Pattern Vocabularies in Web Design</a></h1>
    
      <p>At the beginning of a web design project, it’s common to inventory content from the existing site. During a <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/content-inventory.html">typical inventory</a> I catalog page titles, urls, author, owner, and metadata in a big spreadsheet. It’s a good way to survey the content and figure out what areas need work.</p>

<p>But inventories can be doubly useful if you use a pattern based design methodology.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>It’s a good opportunity to start thinking about what design patterns are needed on the new site. I’ve added additional columns to my inventory spreadsheet template for pattern names, categories, and descriptions. When I review and audit the inventory I look at the existing site for elements and sections that are similar or repeated often. Things to note, particularly in sites that weren’t built with patterns in mind, include sidebars, buttons, calls to action, or any similar elements that I see over and over again.</p>

<p>I’m also starting to think about vocabulary. What patterns need unique names and how do I classify them? This taxonomy – the pattern names and their classification – will form the basis of a pattern library later in the design process.</p>

      Additional columns added for pattern planning: pattern (name), category, and description. Also, there were no heading tags so I've made a note to correct them in the new site architecture.

  </figure>

<p>My HTML, CSS, and front-end JavaScript are all created to address needs cataloged during this early inventory. It’s a great place to start whether you use <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a> or your own system, like I do.</p>

    <h1><a href="/year-in-review-2016">Year In Review: 2016</a></h1>
    
      <p>2016 was a big set up year for me.</p>

<p>I worked on starting a side business selling design services and got ready to take on some clients. I <em>only just</em> finished everything by the end of the year – and I really had to stretch myself to get it done. But I’m happy to note that I’ll be taking clients in 2017.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick list of what I did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Switched departments at work, from Software Development to Marketing</li>
  <li>Changed job titles, from Front-end Developer to User Experience Designer</li>
  <li>Went to Web Design Day in Pittsburgh, a great conference</li>
  <li>Registered my business</li>
  <li>Completed my business plan</li>
  <li>Launched my website</li>
  <li>Landed my first client</li>
  <li>Almost bought a house</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>At work I changed my job title to User Experience designer allowing me to focus more fully on research, strategy, analytics, and A/B testing.</p>

<p>Starting a side business while working full-time has been a challenge. More often than not I’m working early in the morning, at night, and on weekends. But I’m committed to making it work and I don’t plan on keeping these hours forever.</p>

<p>I also spent a lot of time creating processes and workflows to make client work more efficient. I’m already a process driven person, but these will help while I balance working a day job with managing a side business.</p>

<p>Looking forward to 2017, I’ll launch a couple of projects that allow me to do more public design work. I can’t say much now, but most of them will be announced and then written about here in the next couple of months.</p>
